# Java CRUD System

This is a simple CRUD system implemented in Java that manages a list of students. It allows the user to add new students, delete existing students, and list all students or specific groups of students (such as only those who have passed or failed the course). The system also calculates the average grade for each student and displays it in the output. It uses an ArrayList to store the student objects and a switch-case statement to handle user input and perform the appropriate action. Overall, it's a basic but functional example of a CRUD system.
